## From within an AppMap Diagram

Normally when asking Navie about your application, AppMap will search through the AppMap Data to find the ones that are most relevant to your question. You can target your question more specifically to an AppMap, representing a test case, API call, or other interaction by clicking the "Ask Navie" box on any AppMap you open.

**NOTE**: When you "Ask Navie from within an AppMap your questions' context will only include the single AppMap.  You can opt to search the entire workspace by selecting the option to "Include the whole workspace".
