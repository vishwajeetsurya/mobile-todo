# AppMap Navie

AppMap Navie is the missing link that improves the power of AI code completers and code assistants. Leveraging the unique ability that AppMap has to understand your code's execution at runtime, Navie transforms this data into a powerhouse of hyper-personalized context-aware insights for AI-assisted coding. 

That means you're not just working with static analysis anymore, and you're not looking at just individual files or functions. With Navie, you can understand the entire codebase at an architectural level, how it behaves and executes, and provide much more detailed answers to your software questions.
