# Postman

After generating your OpenAPI definitions you can import to [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) as a new collection or update an existing collection. 

To add your OpenAPI definition to Postman start by selecting the _Import_ button found in the top right corner of the Postman UI.

Next, select the path to where you saved your OpenAPI definition. Alternatively if you have committed the file to a repository or pushed to a 3rd party API hosting service you can select a code repository or link as the location.

After Postman validates your OpenAPI definition, you can adjust any advanced settings or accept the default import settings.

After the import completes you'll see a full tree view of your OpenAPI definitions that were generated by AppMap. You can now use Postman to interact with the APIs.

Refer to the [Postman documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/) for additional details on using Postman to interact with your APIs.
