# AppMap Docs

AppMap is a developer tools platform powered by runtime analysis and AI. It's composed of three components:

* Navie - AI code architect.  
* AppMap data - Runtime traces of your application runtime.  
* AppMap diagrams - Interactive visualizations of AppMap data.  

By using AppMap data, Navie is the first AI code architect with the context to understand how your app works when it runs, like a principal engineer or software architect. AppMap data provides Navie with accurate information about application behavior, APIs, database queries, and more, providing valuable context so you can ask more challenging questions and get better answers.

Over 90,000 software developers are using the [AppMap extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=appland.appmap) and the [AppMap plugin for JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16701-appmap).
