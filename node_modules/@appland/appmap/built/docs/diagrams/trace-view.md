# Trace View

The Trace view diagram shows all the details of how a feature works. Here you can navigate forward, backward, up, and down through a detailed execution trace. See the call tree starting with web service endpoints going through function calls all the way to SQL operations. At any point, you can move quickly back and forth between the Trace view and your source code.

The Trace view is fully interactive. You can:
- [Expand and collapse execution paths](#expand-and-collapse-execution-paths)
- [Explore callers and callees](#explore-callers-and-callees)
- [View variable names and values at any point in the code flow](#view-variable-names-and-values-at-any-point-in-the-code-flow)
- [View SQL queries](#view-sql-queries)
- [Open source code right to the line of any particular function](#open-source-code-right-to-the-line-of-any-particular-function)
