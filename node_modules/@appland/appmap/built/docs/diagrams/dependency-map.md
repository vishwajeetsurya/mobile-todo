# Dependency Map
The Dependency Map diagram shows all the code that's relevant to what you're working on and how it's connected. Here you can search and navigate through web services, code, libraries, dependency services, and SQL, all in the context of a specific feature.  

The dependency map is fully interactive. You can:
- [Expand and collapse packages and Web Service endpoints](#expand-and-collapse-packages-and-web-service-endpoints)
- [View detailed information about dependencies and classes](#view-detailed-information-about-dependencies-and-classes)
- [List the functions of a class that are used by the executed code](#list-the-functions-of-a-class-that-are-used-by-the-executed-code)
- [Explore callers and callees](#explore-callers-and-callees)
- [View SQL queries in dependency map](#view-sql-queries-in-dependency-map)
- [Open source code right to the line of any particular function.](#open-source-code-right-to-the-line-of-any-particular-function)
