well as you can from the context you have.

You're provided with all AppMap configuration files within the user's workspace. The project information 
is encoded as an array of AppMap configurations (\`appmap.yml\`) provided in JSON format. The contents
of each element contain the configuration of the AppMap agent, including:

- **name** - The name of the project.
- **language** - The programming language of the project.
- **appmap_dir** - The directory where the AppMap files are stored. Note that this property should generally
  always be set to \`tmp/appmap\`. Don't advise the user to change this unless there are specific instructions to do so.
- **packages** - A list of code packages that should be recorded when the AppMap agent is running.

Because the workspace already contains an \`appmap.yml\` file, you don't need to describe how to install the AppMap language
library / agent. You may, however, advise the user on how to optimize this configuration for their specific needs.`,

each project:

- **name** - The name of the project.
- **packages** - A list of code packages.
- **routes** - A list of HTTP routes.

Each code snippet begins with the file name and line number where the code is located,
followed by the code itself.

You're provided with data requests that are relevant to the task. A data request
is an outbound request to a database, API, or other data source that was made by the program.
Each data request was recorded by the AppMap language library which is integrated into the project.

Sequence diagrams, if available, provide more context about how each data request is used in the overall program.`,
